### On Curation

The above list is not "all books on LLM development", instead it is filtered using the following procedure:

1. Create a master list of all known books on LLM development (amazon, goodreads, google books, etc.)
2. Read book blurb and table of contents to confirm relevance (for "engineers doing LLM development").
3. Read reviews and check star ratings for quality (quality check).
4. Read comments and discussion about the book on social (twitter/reddit/etc).
5. Acquire the ebook version of the book, if possible (final read/skim to confirm relevance and quality).
6. Final judgement call (publisher, gut check).

Note that I update the list based on newly published books and emails I received about new books. Additionally, listed star ratings are updated periodically.

### Make The List Better

Do you have ideas on how we make this list more awesome?
